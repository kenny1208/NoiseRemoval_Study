# A Comparative Study of DnCNN and Traditional Filters for Multi-Type Image Noise Removal

This repository contains the code and resources for my research project:  
**"A Comparative Study of DnCNN and Traditional Filters for Multi-Type Image Noise Removal."**  
The accompanying paper (included as a PDF in this repo) presents a systematic comparison between the deep learning model **DnCNN** and traditional filtering techniques (Median, Gaussian, and Low-Pass) for denoising images corrupted by multiple noise types.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **DnCNN Deep Learning Model**

  - Residual learning CNN for denoising.
  - Mixed loss function (Charbonnier + MSE).
  - Dynamic noise-ratio training strategy for robustness.

- **Traditional Filters (C++ Implementations)**

  - Median Filter: effective against Salt-and-Pepper noise.
  - Gaussian Filter: suppresses Gaussian noise.
  - Low-Pass Filter: averages neighborhood pixels but may blur edges.

- **Noise Generation**

  - Tools to add Gaussian, Salt-and-Pepper, and Random noise to grayscale BMP images.

- **Evaluation**
  - Metrics include PSNR, SSIM, and MSE.
  - Jupyter notebook (`metric.ipynb`) for analysis and visualization.

## ðŸ“ˆ Experimental Results

- **DnCNN** performed best on Gaussian and Random noise (highest PSNR & SSIM, lowest MSE).
- **Median Filter** outperformed DnCNN on Salt-and-Pepper noise, showing classical filters still have value in specific scenarios.
